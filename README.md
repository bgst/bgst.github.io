# Current projects
As senior software engineer and teamlead I am involved in several projects. This is my main public page where I keep a list of the current projects I am working on, the part of my work which can be disclosed.

- A data transformation client tool/server component for large volumes, supporting contextual enrichment of processed information using a plugin architecture. This can be used in various pipelines and processes, such as during augmentation of processed data, both early stage and later on in the lifecycle.
- An AI assisted autonomous agent supporting decision making on a daily basis for knowledge workers based upon personal, weighted decision matrices and a network of weighted, influencing parties.
